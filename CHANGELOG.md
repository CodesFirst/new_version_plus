## 0.0.1

#### Version oiginal:

- #117: Make compatible with new Play Store UI
- #75: Add `forceAppVersion` field to make testing easier.
- #77: Improve `canUpdate` logic so that greater local version won't prompt for an update.
- #50: Check for empty result from iOS App Store if the app does not exist in the store
- #45: Check if What's New text exists before accessing it to prevent crash.
- Optional field `releaseNotes` added to `VersionStatus`, which contains the release notes for a published app.
- Optional parameter `allowDismissal` added to `showUpdateDialog` function. When it is set to false, the plugin prevents the user from dismissing the update dialog. By default it is true.
- `NewVersion` now only has three fields `iOSId`, `androidId`, and `iOSAppStoreCountry`. The other fields have been turned into parameters for the individual functions.
- `VersionStatus` can no longer be directly instantiated by the user.
- Migrated to null-safety, so certain fields are now `final` or non-null, which may break your code.
- `canUpdate` now checks that the local version is _smaller_ than the store version, not just that it is unequal.
- Add `iOSAppStoreCountry` parameter to allow app lookup in a different country's App Store
- Bump packages to latest version
- Migrate from `package_info` to `package_info_plus`
- Clean up example project
- Document all parameters in README
- Add more granular parameters, fix Android web view and navigation bugs.
- Fix HTTPS bug on iOS. Fix null return for android version statuses. Upgrade dependencies.
- Initial release. API includes `getVersionStatus` and `showAlertIfNecessary` methods. Support for iOS and Android.
